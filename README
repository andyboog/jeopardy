This is JEOPARD (or a slight variation of it)
These are the roles (so far):
  1. Java Translator - Kevin 
  2. Graphics - Josh
  3. Trivia Finder (don't know if this is the correct term)- Dylan
  4. Data Structures - Andrea
 
 Let's see how this goes! 
 
First Goal (try to have done by Monday or Wednesday?):
  1. Kevin - research / get comfortable with commands in Java?
  2. Josh - find a cool way to write "Jeopardy" using ASCII art. 
  3. Dylan - create the question categories and add (at least, maybe?) one question to each category.
  4. Andrea - finish writing the data structure to calculate scores/keep track of lives. (Also, start working on main.) 
 Note: Let's try to get a skeleton running before the intermediate deadline (next Friday)! :)
