This is JEOPARDY (or a slight variation of it)
These are the roles (so far):
  1. Networking - Kevin 
  2. Graphics - Josh
  3. Trivia Finder (don't know if this is the correct term)- Dylan
  4. Data Structures - Andrea
 
 Let's see how this goes! 
 
**Week One - UPDATE!! (cause I'm lame like that lol) 
  1. Kevin - Thanks so much for teaching us all how to use github!!! 
  2. Josh - The art is looking super cool, dude!! 
  3. Dylan - I love the obscureness (I think that's a word) of your questions! 
  4. Andrea - It would be silly to write something about myself lol. 
 Things are looking great so far! Keep it up!! :))
