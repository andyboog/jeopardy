This is JEOPARDY (or a slight variation of it)
In this 2-player game, you will be asked a variety of questions. 
If you get the question right, you will gain the number of points associated with the question.
If you get the question wrong, you will lose the number of points associated with the question.
If you reach 0 points before answering the last question, you will automatically lose.
However, if you and your competitor both make it through all of the questions, the one with the higher amount of points will win! 

Good luck! 



Notes:
  These are the roles (so far):
    1. Networking - Kevin 
    2. Graphics - Josh
    3. Trivia Finder (don't know if this is the correct term)- Dylan
    4. Data Structures - Andrea
 
   Let's see how this goes! 
 
  **Week One - UPDATE!! (cause I'm lame like that lol) 
    1. Kevin - Thanks so much for teaching us all how to use github!!! 
    2. Josh - The art is looking super cool, dude!! 
    3. Dylan - I love the obscureness (I think that's a word) of your questions! 
    4. Andrea - It would be silly to write something about myself lol. 
  Things are looking great so far! Keep it up!! :))
